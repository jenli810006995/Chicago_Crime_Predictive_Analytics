# Chicago_Crime_Predictive_Analytics
This is the latest predictive analytics I have done for the summer in 2019. 
The data set is in total 1.6 GB. I did variable selection and applied random forest with or without cross validation,
conditonal inference trees, KNN-CV, and SVM with linear kernel. Due to facility restriction and internet issues, and I was
given two weeks to finish it, I got the results for random forest with and without 3-fold cross validation and the error rate
is about 24.3%-26.22%, which I assume decent for this case. If given better facility and more time, I expect to finish conditonal 
inference trees model and SVM with linear kernel and compare them with random forest.
